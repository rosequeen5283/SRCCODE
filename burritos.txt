  Hi, here's a short essay I wrote about "burritos".

  Burritos are a food. I like burritos. How do you spell burritos? B-u-r-r-i-t-o-s.
  B is the second letter of the alphabet, after A.
  U is the 21st letter of the alphabet, after T.
  R is the 18th letter of the alphabet, after Q.
  R is the 18th letter of the alphabet, after Q.
  I is the ninth letter of the alphabet, after H.
  T is the 20th letter of the alphabet, after S.
  O is the 15th letter of the alphabet, after N.
  S is the 19th letter of the alphabet, after R.
  Yay burritos!

P.S. I heard my friend Bob wrote an essay too, but about watermelons. Check out his essay in watermelons.txt.
